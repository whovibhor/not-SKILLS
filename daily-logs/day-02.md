# ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ April 14, 2025

## âœ… What I Did Today
- Watched Git Merge videos
- Practiced `merge`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `reset`, `revert`
- Resolved merge conflicts

## ðŸ¤” Challenges
- Understanding the difference between `merge` and `rebase`
- Resolving merge conflicts in large files

## ðŸ”œ What's Next?
- Review GitHub Actions documentation
- CI/CD pipelines
- Implementing on a real project

## What I Learned
- The difference between `merge` and `rebase`:
  - `merge` creates a new commit that combines changes from two branches
  - `rebase` moves the entire branch to a new base commit, rewriting history
- `rebase` is cleaner but can be risky if not done carefully
- `cherry-pick` allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another 
- useful for bug fixes or feature backports
- `reset` and `revert` are used to undo changes, but they work differently:
  - `reset` changes the commit history (destructive)
  - `revert` creates a new commit that undoes changes (non-destructive)
- `git stash` is useful for temporarily saving changes without committing them
