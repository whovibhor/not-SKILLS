# 📅 Day 1 – April 13, 2025

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Watched Git basics videos
- Practiced `init`, `add`, `commit`, `status` , 'push' , 'pull' , 'UpStreams'
- Initialized this repository

## 🤔 Challenges
- Confused about when to use `pull` vs. `fetch`
- Dangling Head Issues

## 🔜 What's Next?
- Merge Conflicts & Advanced PR's
- Resolving common errors
- Github Actions

## What I Learned
- That when creating a new branch it copies the same from the branch we are currently on
  eg. we are on main branch and if we create a new branch the new branch will have same content as of main, similarly we are on other branch and making a new brach from there so the new nrach will have the same content as of other branch,
  command to copy the content of some branch to new without moving into it : git branch new-branch other-branch

- Learned PR's through Github's GUI


## ⏰ Hours Spent: 1.5 h
